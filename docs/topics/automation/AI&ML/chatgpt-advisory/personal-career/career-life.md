Reflecting on a Lifetime of Achievement: A Career Summary
As I look back on my long and varied career, I am filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. From my earliest days as a young professional, I knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world, and I am happy to say that I have done just that.

I began my career in platform automation engineering, where I quickly made a name for myself as a hardworking and dedicated professional. Through the years, I have had the opportunity to work on some truly groundbreaking projects, and I am proud to have played a role in shaping the industry as we know it today.

As I progressed in my career, I took on more and more responsibility, eventually rising to the level of adopting and implementing automation in the business. This was a truly defining moment in my professional life, as it solidified my reputation as a leader and expert in my field. Other than that, I would like to learn Golang, AWS cloud and cloud native projects such as Kubernetes in depth to enhance my career life by Year 2025.

In addition to my professional accomplishments, I am also proud of the impact I have had on my community. Throughout my career, I have been an active volunteer, giving back to those in need and making a difference in the lives of others. In this year, my endgoal is to start a quarter worklife summary, write all technology collection terms (jargon) and start a bi-weekly tech blogs on self-hosted journey.

Looking ahead, I am excited to see what the future holds. While I may be nearing the end of my career, I know that there are still many great things to come. I am confident that my legacy will live on through the work I have done and the lives I have touched, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have made a difference in this world.

As a platform engineer, I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and the endless possibilities it holds. Recently, I decided to take my interest to the next level by setting up my own homelab. For those who don’t know, a homelab is a personal lab for experimentation and learning, where one can play around with different equipment, software, and techniques to gain hands-on experience and improve their skills. In this blog post, I want to share my experience setting up my homelab, the challenges I faced, and the things I have learned.

Equipment: I have a 4 protectli ports, on which I installed Proxmox and virtualized my router. This created a network hypervisor that I use to run my VPN and network-related server and client such as Guacamole, Headscale server and RustDesk agent. I also have a workstation that serves as a compute hypervisor and a few Raspberry Pi’s for management purpose.

Software: The main OS I used is Rocky Linux and Proxmox for virtualization software. I also used automation tools such as Packer, Vagrant, Terraform, and Ansible to build and automate my homelab. I’m self-managing my kubernetes services to self-host some services that is helping my lifestyle such as password manager, cloud storage service, monitoring service and many more! It is mostly a toolchain of combination of open source tool. I’m also using a few cloud services such as cloudflare, mattermost, zoho, backblaze and etc!

Experiments: I have been conducting various experiments in my homelab, such as self-hosting services like exposing service publicly, improving networking and security fundamentals, maintaining workloads, automating my infrastructure, and learning container platforms and CNCF technologies.

Lessons Learned: Through setting up my homelab, I have learned a lot about networking and security concepts such as proxy, load balancing, centralized authentication, DNS, email and many more, as well as gaining experience with trend technologies and cloud-native tools.

In conclusion, Setting up my own homelab has been a challenging but rewarding experience. I have learned a lot about different technologies, best practices, and troubleshooting. I hope this blog posting journey has been helpful for those who are thinking of setting up their own homelab, and I look forward to sharing more of my journey in the future. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
